I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in the Department of [https://orfe.princeton.edu/home Operations Research and Financial Engineering] at Princeton University under the supervision of Professor [https://fan.princeton.edu/ Jianqing Fan] and Professor [https://sites.google.com/view/cjin/home Chi Jin]. Before coming to Princeton, I received my bachelor's degree from School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University in 2021.\n
I am interested in theory and applications of statistics and machine learning.\n
